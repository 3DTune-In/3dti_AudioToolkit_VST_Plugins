3DTI HEARING AID SIMULATOR v1.1.0

The 3DTI Hearing Aid Simulator plugin was developed by Ragnar Hrafnkelsson, under the supervision of Lorenzo Picinali and Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, as a VST interface for the hearing aid simulation within the 3D Tune-In Toolkit. 

More information about the 3D Tune-In Toolkit can be found in the open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit/. Technical details about the 3D Tune-In Toolkit spatialiser are described in:
